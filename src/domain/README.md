## Domain Layer
The Domain Layer is a key component in the Clean Architecture approach, which represents the core of the application's business logic and rules. It contains the essential concepts, entities, value objects, and domain services that model the problem domain and enable the application to perform its main functions.

More specifically, the Domain Layer encapsulates the following elements:

1. **Entities**: These are the main objects or concepts in the problem domain that the application needs to manage and manipulate. Entities represent the state and behavior of real-world objects and are the primary focus of the domain layer.

2. **Value Objects**: These are objects that represent some concept within the domain, but they do not have a unique identity. Value objects are usually immutable and can be used as attributes or properties of entities.

3. **Domain Services**: These are objects that contain domain-specific logic and behavior that does not fit within any entity or value object. They are responsible for enforcing business rules and performing complex operations that require coordination between multiple entities or value objects.

4. **Aggregates**: These are groups of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit of consistency and transactionality within the domain layer.

5. **Repository Interfaces**: These are contracts or interfaces that define the methods and operations for storing and retrieving entities from persistent storage. The repository interface serves as a boundary between the domain layer and the data access layer, allowing for separation of concerns and ease of testing.

Overall, the Domain Layer contains the core business logic and concepts of the application and serves as the foundation for the other layers in Clean Architecture. By encapsulating the domain logic in this layer, the application becomes more modular, flexible, and maintainable, and it is easier to evolve and adapt to changing business requirements.
